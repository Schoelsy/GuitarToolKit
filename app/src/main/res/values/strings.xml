     the original chords, then how many tones you want to change it and then arrow up to transpose it higher or arrow down
    to transpose it lower. \n\nTo transpose all the variations of the chords (e.g C(7/9)) ignore the numbers and just add them
    after transpositions to your new chords.\nNOTE: "A#" is standing for "B", large letters stands for majors, little letters stays for minors. 
        \n\nAfter each chord make a space to separate it.\n\nHave a nice play!</string>
